# OpenAI Agents Go SDK

The OpenAI Agents SDK is a lightweight yet powerful framework for building
multi-agent workflows. It is provider-agnostic, supporting the OpenAI Responses
and Chat Completions APIs, as well as other LLMs.

This is a Go port of [OpenAI Agents Python SDK](https://openai.github.io/openai-agents-python/)
(see its license [here](https://github.com/openai/openai-agents-python/tree/main?tab=MIT-1-ov-file#readme)).
This project aims at being as close as possible to the original Python
implementation, for both its behavior and the API. 

#### CAUTION: Work in Progress

A significant set of core functionalities has been already implemented and
works well. The project is under active development: we are implementing
missing features, adding tests, and refactoring the code for a smoother usage.
Please expect the SDK's API to change also significantly before we release
a first stable version.
